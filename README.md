Game AI Game Engine

The Game AI Game Engine (GAIGE) is a set of instructional programming assignments for the Game Artificial Intelligence course taught at Georgia Tech. 

GAIGE is a game engine built in python on top of the PyGame library that provides basic 2-D game functionality. Through a series of assignments, one will build up all the AI components needed to have AI agents play a game based roughly on the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre of game.
