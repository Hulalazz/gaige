The files in this folder are an implementation of a quad tree space partitioning data structure that is useful for speeding up collision checking, increasing the frame rate of the game engine. This can be used in all homework assignments using GAIGE, and is especially useful in the state machine, behavior tree, MOBA competition, and squad homeworks to speed up both debugging and grading.

To use this implementation, replace core.py and utils.py with the versions in this folder, and add QuadTree.py to the root directory of the project.
